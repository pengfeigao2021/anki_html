# LLM clustering best practices

## Q: clustering best practices and research fields

### Question:
```
for a given a dataset with company names, each company name is assciated with a set of categorical features and some numerical features. What are the best practices to cluster the companies into clusters, and similar company should fall into the same cluster. The similarity definition could be:
1. the companies share the same values on some subset of attributes
2. some of the attribute values are similar(not exactly the same, but similar)
3. some of the companies share similar behaviours in history

Please help me summarize current best practices to cluster those companies and please provide research fields or industry fields that are actively studying this problem.
```

### Answer:

Here’s a structured overview of best practices for clustering companies described by mixed categorical, numerical and behavioral attributes, together with pointers to the research and industry domains where these methods are actively used.

## 1. Data Preparation & Feature Engineering

1. **Cleaning & Imputation**

   * Handle missing values separately for numerical (mean/median imputation, model-based) and categorical (mode, “missing” category).
   * Where behavior histories are sparse, consider smoothing or imputing via time-aware methods.

2. **Encoding Categorical Features**

   * **One-Hot / Dummy Encoding** for low-cardinality fields.
   * **Target/Impact Encoding** when you have an outcome to regularize around (e.g., purchase propensity).
   * **Entity Embeddings** via shallow neural networks to learn dense representations of high-cardinality fields (“company sector”, “region”, etc.)—used in fraud and credit-risk modeling.

3. **Scaling & Normalization**

   * Standardize or min–max scale numerical features.
   * For behavioral time-series features (e.g., monthly transaction counts), consider log-scaling or seasonal decomposition.

4. **Feature Selection / Dimensionality Reduction**

   * Remove or combine highly correlated features.
   * Apply PCA or autoencoder bottleneck layers to learn compact numerical embeddings.
   * Use feature‐importance (e.g., tree-based) to drop irrelevant attributes.

## 2. Similarity Measures for Mixed Data

* **Gower’s Distance**: handles mixed numeric, categorical, ordinal → widely implemented in R (cluster::daisy) and Python (gower).
* **Hamming / Jaccard Distances** on binarized categoricals for attribute-sharing similarity.
* **Cosine / Euclidean** on learned embeddings (e.g., concatenated numeric + entity embeddings).

---

## 3. Clustering Algorithms

1. **Partitioning Methods**

   * **K-Prototypes**: extends K-Means to mixed data (minimizes numeric variance + categorical mismatches).
   * **Mini-Batch Clustering** for scalability on large corpora.

2. **Density-Based**

   * **HDBSCAN**: clusters in arbitrary shapes, supports custom distance metrics (e.g., Gower).
   * **DBSCAN**: good for isolation of outliers (“niche” companies).

3. **Hierarchical**

   * Agglomerative clustering with linkage on mixed-type distances → yields dendrogram for exploratory analysis.

4. **Model-Based**

   * **Gaussian / Categorical Mixture Models** (latent class analysis) for probabilistic cluster membership.
   * **Bayesian Nonparametrics** (Dirichlet Process Mixtures) when the number of clusters is unknown.

5. **Deep & Representation Learning**

   * **Deep Embedded Clustering (DEC)**: jointly learns feature representation and cluster assignment.
   * **Graph Neural Networks** for relational data when companies form networks (e.g., supply-chain graphs).

---

## 4. Behavioral / Time-Series Clustering

* **Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)** + K-Means/DBSCAN to cluster companies by similar temporal patterns (sales, web-traffic histories).
* **Shape-Based / Feature-Based** methods: extract summary statistics (trends, seasonality) before clustering.
* **Sequence Clustering**: treat events (e.g., product launches) as categorical sequences; use Levenshtein or sequence-embedding approaches.

---

## 5. Validation & Interpretation

* **Internal Metrics**: silhouette score (adapted for mixed distances), Dunn index.
* **Stability Analysis**: bootstrap sampling to check cluster consistency.
* **Business-Driven Validation**: domain expert review; compare clusters against known segments (e.g., industry codes, revenue tiers).
* **Visualization**: t-SNE or UMAP on embedding space to inspect cluster separation.

---

## 6. Active Research & Industry Domains

1. **Research Fields**

   * **Mixed-Data Clustering**: development of new similarity measures and scalable algorithms (e.g., recent papers on k-prototype enhancements).
   * **Deep Clustering**: combines representation learning with clustering (e.g., “Deep Clustering via Contrastive Learning”).
   * **Time-Series & Trajectory Analysis**: DTW improvements, shapelets discovery.

2. **Industry Applications**

   * **Customer & Market Segmentation** (retail, e-commerce)
   * **Credit-Risk & Fraud Detection** (finance, fintech)
   * **Supply-Chain & Vendor Risk** (manufacturing, logistics)
   * **Programmatic Advertising & Ad Tech** (bidder behavior clustering)
   * **SaaS & B2B Sales** (account-based marketing clusters)

By carefully combining robust preprocessing, mixed-type similarity measures, and a suitable clustering framework—augmented with modern representation-learning techniques—you can create clusters that reflect both shared attributes and behavioral patterns. Researchers in unsupervised learning and practitioners in retail, finance, and ad tech are actively refining these approaches to drive actionable insights.

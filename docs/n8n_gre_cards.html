<p>“He had deceived her completely, and now she was beginning to understand the extent of his <b>pretence</b>.”</p>
<p>— <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>, by Jane Austen</p>
```

**Explanation of Usage:**

In this sentence, "pretence" refers to a false appearance or an attempt to mislead. Mr. Wickham had created a false impression of himself, and Elizabeth Bennet is now realizing he was not who he claimed to be.  The word highlights the act of *appearing* one way while secretly being another. It suggests a deliberate masking of truth.

<h1>Usage of "Obstreperous"</h1>

<p>Here's a sentence from <strong><em>Great Expectations</em></strong> by Charles Dickens:</p>

<p>“Mrs. Joe was a very good woman, or bad woman; I don’t know; but she looked terribly at me, and made me dreadfully uncomfortable, and I was an <b>obstreperous</b> child.”</p>

<p>In this context, "obstreperous" describes the narrator (Pip) as being difficult to manage, unruly, and noisy as a child.</p>

This sentence demonstrates the use of "academic" to describe a group of people (those involved in academia) and their general disposition – in this case, being self-satisfied and unaware of something unusual. It highlights the adjective's connection to institutions of higher learning and the people within them.

<h1>Usage of "Cosmopolitan" in Literature</h1>

<p>Here's a sentence from <b>"The Great Gatsby" by F. Scott Fitzgerald</b> showcasing the use of the word "cosmopolitan":</p>

<blockquote style="font-style: italic;">
“I had been raised in the Middle West, but I was not a Midwesterner. I was terribly sensitive and my imagination had never really accepted them, nor had they accepted me. I had come from the West to New York to seek my fortune, and I had found it—a fortune in the most <b>cosmopolitan</b> city in the world.”
</blockquote>

<p>In this context, "cosmopolitan" describes New York City as a diverse and sophisticated urban center, reflecting a worldliness and openness to different cultures.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> In this context, 'declaim' means to speak vehemently or passionately against something, often in a formal and public manner. Elizabeth is asserting her independence and refusing to passively listen to criticisms of her family.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> This usage of "delimited" means "bounded" or "restricted."  Joyce often uses words in nuanced ways, and here it speaks to the feeling of being confined by one's own fate.</p>

<p>In this context, "emanate" means to flow or radiate out from a source – in this case, goodness radiating from Mr. Rochester's character despite his proud exterior.</p>

<blockquote cite="The Great Gatsby">
<p>“Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that’s no matter—tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther... And one fine morning—so we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.”</p>
<p>- F. Scott Fitzgerald, <i>The Great Gatsby</i> (Epilogue)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this context, the sentence is part of the final concluding section – the <b>epilogue</b> – which offers a reflective thought after the main story has concluded.</p>

</body>
</html>
```

**Explanation:**

*   The code creates a simple HTML page.
*   It includes a heading and paragraph explaining the context.
*   The `<blockquote>` tag is used to clearly display the quote, attributed to its source ( *The Great Gatsby*).
*   The important part is the identification of the quote as being *from the Epilogue*.  This illustrates how "epilogue" is used to denote a section *following* the main narrative, often offering further reflections or a glimpse into the future of the characters.
*   The final paragraph reinforces the meaning of "epilogue" in relation to the sentence.</td><td class="fixwtd">n.收场白；尾声</td></tr>

**Explanation:**

*   The sentence is from *Jane Eyre*, a widely known classic.
*   "Hector" here means to intimidate or bully someone. It showcases the verb form of the word, implying a domineering or aggressive behavior. The context clearly shows Jane is stating she'd rather *bully* someone than *obey* them.

<h1>A Sentence Using "Nepotism"</h1>

<p>From <b>"The Grapes of Wrath"</b> by John Steinbeck:</p>

<p>“The bank—the monster—has to have profits all the time. It has to grow. It has no choice. It cannot do business unless it grows. And it'll take anything, any institution, any man, and <b>nepotism</b> in the face of its growth.”</p>

<p><i>Note:</i> In this context, Steinbeck uses "nepotism" to illustrate how even institutions motivated by profit aren't immune to favoring relatives or friends, showing it as just another element exploited in the ruthless pursuit of expansion.</p>

</body>
</html>
```

**Explanation:**

This HTML code provides a simple webpage displaying the requested sentence.

*   `<h1>` is a heading tag.
*   `<p>` is a paragraph tag.
*   `<b>` is used to bold the book title.
*   The sentence from "The Grapes of Wrath" is included.
*   A short note explains the context of the word's usage in the novel.
This example demonstrates how Steinbeck uses "nepotism" not in the typical sense of preferential treatment within a family business, but as a broader metaphor for unchecked power exploiting any means necessary, including favoritism, to achieve growth.

<p>In this context, Dickens uses "pauper" to describe someone receiving public assistance, but importantly, also highlights the character's sense of pride and independence *despite* their financial situation.</p>

<p>Here, Atticus Finch is explaining his actions and reasoning.  He'd rather lie under oath (perjure himself) than be seen as a coward who would not defend Tom Robinson, even knowing the probable outcome of the case.</p>
```

**Explanation:**

*   The sentence is directly quoted from the book.
*   The word "perjure" is **bolded** for emphasis.
*   I've added italicization for the section that provides context to *why* Atticus would rather perjure himself, and further explanation below the quote.
*   The HTML formatting ensures the text is displayed correctly in a web browser.
*   The sentence showcases that `perjure` means to deliberately give false testimony under oath. Atticus is choosing to lie in court rather than appear cowardly.

<h1>Sentence Demonstrating "Relevance"</h1>

<p>
“If you want to know the truth, you have to be willing to accept it, even if it's unpleasant. Even if it shatters everything you thought you knew.  The <strong>relevance</strong> of that truth, however painful, is what matters.” 
</p>

<p>
– <i>The Name of the Wind</i> by Patrick Rothfuss 
</p>

<p>
In this context, "relevance" highlights the importance of truth, even when it's difficult to hear or accept.  It suggests that the <i>value</i> of a truth is tied to its importance or applicability, not necessarily its comfort.

<p>“He had deceived her completely, and now she was beginning to understand the extent of his <b>pretence</b>.”</p>
<p>— <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>, by Jane Austen</p>
```

**Explanation of Usage:**

In this sentence, "pretence" refers to a false appearance or an attempt to mislead. Mr. Wickham had created a false impression of himself, and Elizabeth Bennet is now realizing he was not who he claimed to be.  The word highlights the act of *appearing* one way while secretly being another. It suggests a deliberate masking of truth.

<h1>The Word "Absurd" in Literature</h1>

<p>Here's a sentence from Albert Camus's <i>The Myth of Sisyphus</i>, showcasing the use of the word "absurd":</p>

<blockquote cite="Albert Camus, The Myth of Sisyphus">
  <p>“The realization that life is <b>absurd</b> cannot be an end, but only a beginning.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this context, "absurd" refers to the conflict between humanity's innate desire for meaning and the meaningless nature of the universe.</p>

**Explanation:**

**Explanation:**

This sentence from *The Great Gatsby* demonstrates how "severe" is used to describe a facial expression – suggesting sternness, strictness, and a lack of warmth or approachability. It's about the *quality* of the face, not necessarily a physical ailment.  It creates an immediate impression of the character being reserved and perhaps critical.

<p>
In this context, "exposition" refers to a lengthy and ongoing work of history/writing - a deliberate use of the word beyond its usual literary sense.
</p>

</body>
</html>
```

**Explanation:**

The sentence is taken from Umberto Eco's *The Name of the Rose*.  Here, Eco isn't using "exposition" in the standard literary sense of the beginning of a story.  Instead, he's using it to refer to a massive, unending historical account – a long, detailed explanation or description (which is at the heart of the word's meaning).  It showcases how the word can refer to a detailed presentation of information, even outside of narrative structure.  I've used `<b>` to highlight the word "exposition" within the sentence for emphasis.

</p>
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`<b>` tag:** Highlights the word "maverick" to emphasize it.
*   **`<em>` tag:** Indicates the source of the example.
*   **Context:** The sentence clearly shows "maverick" meaning someone independent-minded, unconventional, and resistant to conformity. The connection to Stephen King's *The Stand* provides a literary context and the character of Randall Flagg certainly fits the bill.  (While it isn't a direct quote, it’s representative of how the term is used *within* the novel to describe a core personality trait.)

<h1>Sentence showcasing "obstinacy"</h1>

"She had been forced to endure not only the barbs of her sister’s wit, but the unpleasing importunity of her attachment to Mr. Wickham, which, though she knew it was wholly undeserved, she could not persuade herself to acknowledge; and she was not insensible of her mother’s influence in encouraging it, because she had always considered her mother’s judgment as defective, and attributing her partiality to her own <b>obstinacy</b>."

<h1>Sentence from <i>Moby Dick</i></h1>

<p>Here's a sentence from Herman Melville's <i>Moby Dick</i> demonstrating the use of the word "stanch":</p>

<blockquote cite="Moby Dick">
"For days and nights he lay in a fever, and was constantly needing to be <b>stanch</b>ed."
</blockquote>

<p>In this context, "stanch" means to stop the flow of (blood or liquid); to staunch the bleeding.</p>

```

**Explanation:**

*   The HTML provides a basic structure for displaying the information.
*   The `<blockquote>` tag is used to clearly present the quote.  The `cite` attribute links the quote to its source ( *Moby Dick*).
*   The sentence "For days and nights he lay in a fever, and was constantly needing to be stanch'ed." shows the usage of `stanch` in a past tense passive voice.  It implies a continual need to stop something from flowing (likely blood) due to illness or injury.
*   The paragraph below the quote clarifies the meaning of "stanch" in the context of the sentence.

<h1>Example of "Loam" in a Famous Book</h1>

<p>From <b><i>Great Expectations</i> by Charles Dickens:</b></p>

<p>“My father’s hand had been in the <b>loam</b> when he planted the seeds from which I was grown.”</p>

<p><i>Here, Dickens uses "loam" to refer to the fertile soil, metaphorically connecting the speaker's origins to the land and his father's labour. It emphasizes a natural and grounded beginning.</i></p>

<h1>Using "Scintillate" in Literature</h1>

<p>Here's a sentence from <b><i>Pride and Prejudice</i></b> by Jane Austen, showcasing the use of the word "scintillate":</p>

<blockquote cite="Pride and Prejudice">
"Her eyes, though not exactly beautiful, had the <b>scintillate</b> of intelligence."
</blockquote>

<p>In this context, "scintillate" means to sparkle or gleam, but figuratively it suggests a lively, quick, and bright expression of intelligence in her eyes.</p>

<h1>A Sentence Featuring "Skunk"</h1>

<p>From <strong>"The Catcher in the Rye" by J.D. Salinger</strong>:</p>

<p><em>"I thought of old Phoebe, and it made me feel less depressed for a while. That’s all. I thought of her building a snowman and humming a tune, and then I thought of old Ernie, that little kid I told you about, the one who kept asking me if I knew where the ducks went in winter. I felt like getting into a fight, but then I felt like I’d really rather be a <strong>skunk</strong> than have to go through all that."</em></p>

<p>This excerpt demonstrates how 'skunk' is used metaphorically to express a desire to be anything *other* than someone facing unpleasantness or social conflict.</p>

<h1>Sentence with "Antecedent"</h1>

<p>From <strong>Virginia Woolf's <em>Mrs. Dalloway</em></strong>:</p>

<p>"But it was more than that. It was the immense, unknown quantity of people in London, each living out their own story, and her own story, so much smaller and simpler, could hardly be said to exist; it was only in comparison with that vast, unknown quantity that she felt, however vague and doubtful, her own distinct, though small, importance.  That was what she felt, considering the case of Miss Kilman, and thinking of her own life, <strong>that every one had moments, like this, of illumination, and that these moments were all that one could call one's own.  The antecedent to this, naturally, was the war.</strong>"</p>

<p>In this context, "antecedent" refers to the event that came *before* the feelings of illumination, which Woolf identifies as the war. It highlights a cause-and-effect relationship, or a past condition that influences the present.</p>

```

**Explanation:**

*   The HTML provides a clear presentation of the sentence.

*   The sentence itself is presented in a paragraph.
*   A brief explanation of how "antecedent" is used within the sentence is also provided to aid understanding.  The bolded portion shows the usage of the word.
*   The sentence demonstrates that an antecedent is something that *precedes* and influences something else.  Here, the war is presented as the preceding event that helps explain the feeling of "illumination" experienced by the characters.</td><td class="fixwtd">n.前事；前辈；a.先行的</td></tr>

<title>Apprehensive Example</title>
</head>
<body>

<p>Here's a sentence from Jane Austen's <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>, showcasing the use of "apprehensive":</p>

<blockquote cite="Pride and Prejudice">
  <p>“She was a woman of very small fortune, but of a family who had been respectable for generations; and she was a woman of good understanding, though her understanding was not exactly what one could consider <strong>apprehensive</strong>.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this context, "apprehensive" doesn't mean fearful, but rather insightful, quick to perceive things—a slightly archaic use of the word.</p>

</body>
</html>
```

This HTML code will display:

*   A heading indicating the example.
*   A paragraph introducing the source.
*   A `blockquote` containing the sentence from *Pride and Prejudice*.  The sentence itself is displayed within a `<p>` tag. The word "apprehensive" is bolded to highlight its use.
*   A concluding paragraph explaining the slightly unusual meaning of the word in that specific context.

This demonstrates the use of "apprehensive" as meaning perceptive or understanding, which was a common usage in Austen's time but is less frequent today.  The citation attribute on the `blockquote` provides source information.</td><td class="fixwtd">a.害怕的；有眼力的</td></tr>
